Well, some of the reasons that you actually want to use packages

is that it makes it actually easier for
programmers to determine that classes are actually related to one thing or another.

Another great reason is it's easy to know where to find the classes and
interfaces that can provide the functions provided by the package.
Cuz they're all sort of in the same group if you will, the same package.

And the other important thing is because the package creates a new namespace
the class and the interface name conflicts are actually avoided as result of that.
Because they're actually in their own separate area.
Which affectively, is what that namespace is,
it's sort of a different area that all these classes and
interfaces are actually sort of put together or placed together.

And importantly, classes within the package, that you create,
have unrestricted access to one another while
they still restrict access for classes outside the package.

So, that's another sort of very important reason why you'd actually want to use
packages.
